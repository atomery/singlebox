No, it does not. We would love to support these web apps. But they rely on a technology called [WidevineDRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widevine) which is not available for Electron because of technical and legal constraints [\[1\]](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/testing-widevine-cdm) [\[2\]](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/04/03/googles_widevine_drm/).
